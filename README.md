# Chatbot-Dialogflow
Trabajo final de FP - Desarrollo de aplicaciones multiplataforma

# ABSTRACT
This project is a chatbot based on a Google tool called Dialogflow.
This tool allows to create an interaction between humans and machines based on natural
language.
The voice and conversation interfaces created with Dialogflow work with a wide range of devices
such as telephones, computers, cars, smart speakers, etc.
Using an Android application I try to simulate a real conversation in addition to adding certain
functionalities that can be very useful as an electronic agenda.
This agenda is a database in Firebase, which is capable of storing almost all types of data. This is
very useful because this application could be used, for example, as a business assistant who will
be responsible for making all reservations, as well as providing information and help to customers
about that company.
This tool also has an algorithm capable of learning by itself, so the more we interact with the bot,
the smarter it will become.
The functionalities of this tool are almost endless, so in this project I have tried to encompass all
those that have seemed most "useful" to me.
